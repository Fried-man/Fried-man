Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! I am grateful you have taken the time to visit and learn more about me. As a Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I have developed a deep love and passion for low-level computer architecture and the fascinating field of artificial intelligence. Additionally, I have a minor in Mathematics, which has helped me approach problem-solving logically and analytically.

I first began programming recreationally in 2012, and since then, my love for computing has only grown stronger. It is a true joy for me to be able to use my skills and knowledge to create meaningful projects and contribute to the tech community.

Please take the time to explore my profile and organizations, and get a sense of the work I am passionate about. Thank you again for stopping by, and I hope you have a wonderful day!
